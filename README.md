Computer vision based recognition of liquid level and surface in images
Recognise and mark the level/surface of liquid in image of liquid in transparent container. 
Input: Image of liquid in a transparent vessel and the boundaries of the vessel in the image (as binary contour image). 
Output: Recognize and mark the level and the surface of the liquids in the vessel. Could be applied to finding surface line between liquid and air and phase boundaries between phase separating liquids. 
Documentation and instruction are included in the readme file. 
The code was made specifically for glass vessels in chemistry laboratory but could be used for other cases of liquid in transparent containers. 
Based on paper: [Computer vision-based recognition of liquid surfaces and phase boundaries in transparent vessels, with emphasis on chemistry applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7174)
